# Bazelings

Bazelings is a set of small, incremental and hands-on exercises to teach you Bazel from the ground up. 

## But why should I learn Bazel?

I made [a talk about this a few years ago](https://youtu.be/sW8b-cgqicc?si=MZxQi0aJJtsfn1M6) and though what I said back then is still valid - as time goes on there are more and more reasons to learn Bazel!

- multilanguage/multiframework builds that need to integrate with each other
- slow/unreproducible builds
- setting up your build host and toolchains is a nightmare

All of these are problems that Bazel can help you solve! Bazel is a build system built with scale and reproducibility in mind, which set it apart from most other build systems. However, it is not a simple tool and that's why this project exists:

"With great speed and reproducibility comes great complexity" - Uncle Ben during his time in Google

## So you want to learn Bazel?

If I have managed to convince you, then I suggest heading over to `exercises/00_intro` (yes, these exercises are 0-indexed) and start reading the readme. Each exercise is a different directory and has a README. Before starting the exercise you should read the README first as it ensures you understand the concepts we'll be covering.

Make sure to have fun and I wish you a good learning! All feedback is welcome and highly appreciated and contributions are even more appreciated!
